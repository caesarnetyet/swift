//To implement the game, you need to create a deck object and shuffle it. Then you need to create a hand object for the player and a hand object for the dealer. You need to deal two cards to each hand and display them. You need to ask the player if they want to hit (get another card) or stand (stop getting cards). If the player hits, you need to deal another card to their hand and check if they are busted. If the player stands, you need to deal cards to the dealerâ€™s hand until their total value is at least 17 or they are busted. Then you need to compare the total values of both hands and determine the winner. You need to repeat this process until the player wants to quit or the deck runs out of cards.
